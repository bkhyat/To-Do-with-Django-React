# Getting started:

### Introduction:
The ToDo application is based on RESTful API, where the backend APIs have been developed 
using python Django web framework, and Django Rest Framework, and the frontend has been 
developed using React JS library.

### Running the application:
- Create a virtual environment : `python -m venv venv`
- activate the virtual environment : `\venv\Scripts\activate`
- Install the requirements from `backend/requirements.txt`: `pip install -r requirements`
- Then start the Django server: `python backend/manage.py runserver`
- The backend server starts
- Install `node.js` if it is not already installed in your application.
- Then go to the frontend directory.
- Install npm packages from `frontend/package.json`
- Start the frontend server with `npm start`
- Finally, go to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
